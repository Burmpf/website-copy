<h2>My Background</h2> <br>
    <p>
      	&emsp; Before I get to how I got into NFT’s and crypto in general, I’d like to talk about something we don’t hear about much, our history.  I grew up in *REDACTED* Indiana. When I was old enough I joined the Marines. For any young buck reading this and for some reason is considering it, don’t. The military is the worst example of how people can be and the best example of why governments can’t be trusted. It was an even better example of where the HUGE federal defense budget gets wasted. Obviously I hated it. I got out the first chance I could. My time working under “the man” gave me a really bad taste in my mouth for the government in general. It was a huge driving force behind my belief in crypto. Mostly transparent and very “for the people, by the people”. <br> <br>

      	 &emsp; One of my friends had put me onto XRP days before the SEC investigation started so I was off to a bad start. I sold all of that because I knew how these things go. Another friend of mine got me into safe moon before it SKYROCKETED which got my crypto investment journey off the ground. I was fortunate enough that the same absolute LEGEND got me into solpunks (a crypto punks knockoff) when SOL was very cheap (20-30$). After I loaded my bags on that the rest was history. Anyone who was around back then knows the rest of the story. I missed most of the big bags like SMB gen 2 , solsocks, solsteads, you get the idea. Since then I slowly flipped my way up to my first smb in February and a handful of other smaller projects.<br><br>

          &emsp; The idea behind this website is to give me a place where I can write my thoughts in a longer format than twitter. If you’ve ever heard my podcast you know Im a very rant-y person so this will work better for me. It will also outline what I’m up to and where Im trying to go. Ive been so in love with the crypto and NFT space that I really want to add more to it. At the time of this writing I’m trying to teach myself how to code. I will have actually coded this whole site so as I get better the website hopefully will too. Right now I’ve started with HTML and CSS. Css is a fucking nightmare but anyone who’s touched it would agree I think. After I have a better grasp of what I’m doing I’ll more onto a different language. I haven’t decided on what it will be yet so if you have a suggestions don’t be afraid to hit me up on twitter or discord. </p>

      <h2>My Biggest Convictions </h2><br>

      	<p>
          &emsp; Again if you’ve heard my podcast you’ll likely know there’s a few projects I really believe in. #1 being the MonkeDao. The overwhelming majority of people involved are good people. Almost all of them are better than me at pretty much everything. They have everything from day traders to lawyers. The board is filled with the best and brightest our space has to offer. Another project I’m not invested in, but not by choice, is DeGods. I’ve talked to Frank a few times and every time I was left with more belief in his ability to lead that project. Opposite from the MonkeDao where it's my belief in the board, DeGods is almost 100% because of Frank. A smaller project that many might not know about and I’m more than happy to try to shed some light on is the Founders. They make custom 1 of 1 PFP’s in the founders style. The best part is you get to work with the team to make the pfp exactly how you want! Mine was based off Broly from Dragon Ball. You get more than just a pop though. You get access to a pretty legit network of alpha callers and WL hunters they’ve brought on so you can count on getting into about any project mints that are coming up if that’s your type of thing. I don’t mint anymore but they also do things like talent shows, pizza nights where they buy your pizza for you, and other nice little things you can only do with smaller, more connected communities. <br>
